  * Install org mode -- maybe convert todo to org mode file.
  * Emacsclient return focus to terminal after killing: [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47496959/how-to-return-focus-to-terminal-after-closing-gui-emacsclient-on-mac-os-x)
  * re-builder (or similar equivalent) with python style raw string regexes
      * an internal emacs [regex101](https://regex101.com/) would be awesome
  * correct diff coloring in eshell (for git diff) [stack overflow](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/9517/colored-git-output-in-eshell)
  * would be cool to have a jenkins build on PR's to check that emacs init.el doesn't break.
  * Markdown live preview doesn't support lists. Fix?
  * [Dired Omit Mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredOmitMode) (with sqk file?)
