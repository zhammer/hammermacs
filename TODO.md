# TODO
  * Convert todo to org mode.
  * Emacsclient return focus to terminal after killing: [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47496959/how-to-return-focus-to-terminal-after-closing-gui-emacsclient-on-mac-os-x)
  * re-builder (or similar equivalent) with python style raw string regexes
      * an internal emacs [regex101](https://regex101.com/) would be awesome
  * reverse markdown sublist indentation commands
      * right now C-u C-j decreases indentation by one level, C-u C-u C-j increases
  * correct diff coloring in eshell (for git diff)
      * or maybe use shell/term?
  * would be cool to have a jenkins build on PR's to check that emacs init.el doesn't break.
  * Add packages to init.el (currently: helm, markdown).
      * see [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10092322/how-to-automatically-install-emacs-packages-by-specifying-a-list-of-package-name) or philippe's exordium [setup](https://github.com/philippe-grenet/exordium/blob/master/init.el#L193)
