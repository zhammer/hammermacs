  * Install org mode -- maybe convert todo to org mode file.
  * Emacsclient return focus to terminal after killing: [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47496959/how-to-return-focus-to-terminal-after-closing-gui-emacsclient-on-mac-os-x)
  * re-builder (or similar equivalent) with python style raw string regexes
      * an internal emacs [regex101](https://regex101.com/) would be awesome
  * correct diff coloring in eshell (for git diff) [stack overflow](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/9517/colored-git-output-in-eshell)
  * would be cool to have a jenkins build on PR's to check that emacs init.el doesn't break.
  * Markdown live preview doesn't support lists. Fix?
  * [Dired Omit Mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredOmitMode) (with sqk file?)
  * Try out [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit)
  * Delay to turn on ido? I like the cleaner display at first
      * Maybe just C-i to switch to ido mode from regular search?
  * Check if it's possible to turn on autofill mode specifically w/in python docstrings.
  * Update github documentation in README
      * Include simple instructions for me and others on how to actually get started with some of these packages, such as magit, helm, etc.
  * Magit
      * Special command to automatically stage, commit & push all root level markdown files.
